Zenses is an open source application scrobble tracks from "MTP":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol compatible devices ("Microsoft Zune":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune, "Creative Zen":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_ZEN, "SanDisk Sansa":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SanDisk_Sansa etc..) to "last.fm":http://last.fm/. Scans through your device to find played tracks to scrobble to "last.fm":http://last.fm/, Zenses will automatically create a timestamp (as MTP devices do not store this information) for each track so "last.fm":http://last.fm/ wont reject scrobbles.

h2. Device Compatibility 

As the Windows version of Zenses uses Windows Media Device Manager 11 SDK, theoretically any device that supports reading track data will work as long as the SDK has support. Zenses has been written purely for MTP devices but it might work with other devices that Windows Media Device Manager 11 SDK supports such as Mass Storage Class (MSC), RAPI. However the storage system used must support storing the played count on each track.

Songbird have a nice chart that lists compatible, since Zenses uses the same Windows Media SDK its safe to assume listed devices will work. You can find it over at there "table":http://wiki.songbirdnest.com/Docs/Device_Support/MTP_Device_Support.
